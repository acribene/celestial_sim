Celestial n-body Simulator

-----------------------------------------------------Overview-----------------------------------------------------
As my undergraduate senior project I will be developing a n-body simulator. I plan on implementing the barnes hut
algorithm in order to handle large scale simulations. I will start with implementing in 2d then progress and
experiment with 3d. My end goad is support roughly 100 3d bodies at 60 fps (I would like to support more
however I wanted to give a resonable first estimate).

A few reasons for choosing this project: 
* I want to expand my skills with C++ and the "GNU" toolset.
* Be forced to actually consider optimization for large scale simulations.
* I've always been interested in physics and this is a perfect way to experiment.
* I'd like to have a easy to use open source tool that students can play around with for eduational purposes
  or simply for fun.

This will be primarily for major changes or alterations with my original plan.
